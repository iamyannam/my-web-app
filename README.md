# my-web-app
This Web application is to showcase my DevOps experience and skills. I have used Python to design the web app.

To run this web application:

1.  Ensure you have Flask installed: pip install flask
2.  Save the Python, HTML, and CSS code into their respective files (app.py, templates/index.html, and static/styles.css).
3.  Run the Flask application: python app.py4.
4.  Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the web application.
5.  If any changes please fork this repository and make changes.
